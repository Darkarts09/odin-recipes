    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The primary ingredient in orange juice is, of course, oranges!
        Generally, commercial orange juice contains 100% pure juice extracted
        from oranges. Some manufacturers might add water or preservatives, and
        some packaged juices might have added vitamins or calcium for
        fortification. However, homemade orange juice typically requires solely
        fresh oranges without additional additives.

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preparation: Wash the oranges thoroughly to remove any dirt or residue
        from the peel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut and Juice: Cut the oranges in half and use a citrus juicer or a
        handheld juicer to extract the juice. You can also use a blender or food
        processor to blend the oranges and then strain the juice through a sieve
        or cheesecloth to separate the pulp.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve: Pour the freshly squeezed juice into a glass and enjoy it
        immediately for the freshest taste and maximum nutritional benefits.
